How To use The Engine
------------------------------
1. Go to SherbertEngine_Server/Server.sln and open in Visual Studio. 
2. Run that first (in debug mode).
3. Open SherbertEngine.sln in a separate studio.
4. Run in debug mode, use local debugger.
5. Engine will start, if console is enabled, it will check for external data.
6. Use y or n to load plugins and save data. (Paths are SherbertEngine/_ExternalData/...
7. Engine will load.
8. Game will run on main window.
9. You can click on the Imgui windows to mess with things (windows may need resizing for your display, just drag corners)
10. Go to Light, and in the drop down select ambience box. Brighten the scene to suit your monitor gamma.
Or you can press the 'Esc' Key to manually control the camera and the nanosuit character.
Note: Nothing gameplay-wise is done and PhysX isn't working properly, I was overwhelmed with how much there is to do.
So, gg, and enjoy my DirectX Blender knockoff.
